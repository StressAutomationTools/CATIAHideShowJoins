# CATIAHideShowJoins
CATIA Macro to Show and save individual joins

Show any non-join parts that are supposed to go into the output igs files.
Run the macro.
You will be prompted to select an output folder.
The program will then hide all joins.

It will then show them one at a time and save them in the output folder with the joins name as the file name.

Finally it will show all joins again.
